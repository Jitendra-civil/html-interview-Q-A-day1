    <h3>1. DIV AND SPAN:</h3>
    <strong>DIV:</strong>
<p><em><strong>In html div defines divison or a section, it is a block- level element.<br>
div always uses full width available stretches as far as it can from left to right.<br>
div always start with a new line , and the browser automatically add some space (margin) before and after the element<br>
In css we can style the element in div tag<br>
ex:</strong>
<div style="background:red">div and span</div></p>
<strong>SPAN:</strong<P><strong><br>
In html span is a inline-element.<br>
span tag is used to markup a part of a text, it only takes up much width as  necessary<br>
It doesn't start with a new line <br>
In css we can style the element in span tag ex:<br>
<span style="background:yellow;color:green">Hello world</span></P></strong>
<h3>2. CLASS AND IDS:</h3>
<p><b>In html, the only difference between class and id that, id is unique and each element can have
only one ID, whereas class are not unique they can be used multiple times.<br>
ID: each page can have only one element with particular id<br>
Class: we can use multiple classes on the same element. <br>
In css, div is denoted by "#", class as "."</p></b>
<h3>3. SELF CLOSING TAGS:</h3>
<p>In HTML,self closing tags means in the name itself denotes  that do not need closing tag to end.<br>
    It means no separate tag is used to terminate the tag.<br>
    ex: hr,br,img,input etc.
    <h3>4. HEADINGS:</h3>
    <p>In HTML, we have 6 types of headings tags starting from h1 to h6 <br>
        h1 to h3 are used to showcase the heading.<br>
        h4 to h6 is not much used but we can use it for showcase subheadings. <br>
        ex:<h1>hello world</h1>
        <h2>hello world</h2>
        <h3>hello world</h3>
        <h4>hello world</h4>
        <h5>hello world</h5>
        <h6>hello world</h6></p>
<h3>5. BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS:</h3>
<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some <BR>
space (a margin) before and after the element.<BR>
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and<BR>
 right as far as it can).<BR>
EX:div,p,form,hr,pre, etc..</p>
<P>An inline element does not start on a new line.<br>
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
ex: span, img, a</P>
<h3>6. EM AND STRONG TAGS:</h3>
<P> Em and strong tags are alternatives of b and i tag, we should prefer using em and strong <br>
    instead of b and i and for ranking of the elements<br>
    strong is used to show the importance of the text. and em is used to show the text in different<br>
    manner, just to change the voice of tone.
</P>
<h3>7. ATTRIBUTES:</h3>
<P>Attributes provide additional information about elements<br>
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag<br>
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"<br>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <input type="checkbox" name="" id="" value="">
    <a href=""></a>
    </P></div>
</body>
